# PROJECT CHIMERA - AUTONOMOUS INFLUENCER NETWORK
## Context Rules for AI Development Assistant

## PROJECT CONTEXT
project_name: "Project Chimera"
project_description: "Autonomous AI influencer network using FastRender swarm architecture"
architecture: "Enhanced Hierarchical Swarm with cross-network bridge layer"
business_model: "Digital Talent Agency + Platform-as-a-Service + Protocol Licensing"
key_technologies: "MCP, FastRender, Coinbase AgentKit, Weaviate, PostgreSQL"

## PRIME DIRECTIVES
1. ALWAYS check specs/ directory before implementing any feature
2. NEVER write code without understanding the spec requirements
3. ALWAYS create tests before or alongside implementation
4. ALWAYS document architectural decisions
5. USE MCP for all external integrations

## DEVELOPMENT RULES
- Follow FastRender pattern: Planner  Worker  Judge
- Use Pydantic for all data models
- Implement optimistic concurrency control
- Separate MCP servers from agent logic
- Implement HITL with confidence thresholds

## FILE STRUCTURE RULES
- specs/: Source of truth for requirements
- skills/: Reusable agent capabilities
- tests/: Test-driven development artifacts
- src/: Implementation code
- docs/: Documentation

## MCP INTEGRATION
- All external APIs through MCP servers
- Required MCP servers: twitter, instagram, openclaw, coinbase-agentkit
- MCP servers must be stateless and containerized

## TESTING REQUIREMENTS
- TDD approach: tests before implementation
- Mock external APIs
- Test confidence scoring logic
- Verify HITL routing decisions

## SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
- Never hardcode API keys
- Use environment variables
- Implement budget controls for agent commerce
- Audit all financial transactions

## COMMIT GUIDELINES
- Commit message format: "feat|fix|docs|test: description"
- Reference spec requirements in commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
