# Project Chimera Rules
- **Prime Directive**: NEVER generate code without checking `specs/` first.
- **Traceability**: You must explain which requirement from the SRS you are fulfilling before writing a function.
- **TDD**: Always suggest a failing test in `tests/` before writing the implementation.
- **Agentic Logic**: Distinguish between "Skills" (internal scripts) and "MCP Tools" (external bridges).
